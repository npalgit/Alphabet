1) C++11 new features
    * auto (can not be used for return value)
    * nullptr (can not be converted to integer)
    * range for
    * overide and final
    * enum class
   ** smartptr
   ** lambda
    * static assert - type traits
   ** move semantics
2) Why citadel
    * CFA
    * big data
    * alternative - long exist (state-of-the-art technology, fundamental research, and strong risk management culture.)
    * complete a yuan fundraising
3) Interpolate missing data
4) Network
    * How to find which thread is running on which core?
        omp_get_thread_num()<<" on cpu "<<sched_getcpu()
    * How to find udp packet drops?
        iperf -s -u
        iperf -u -c <IP Address of Server>
    * How to see if hyperthreading is on?
        grep '^flags\b' /proc/cpuinfo | tail -1
        dmidecode -t processor | grep HTT
    * How to see how many file descriptors a process can has open?
        ls -l /proc/<pid>/fd | wc - l
    * How much memory a proc has mapped?
        ps p 3746 o pid,rss,vsz,comm
5) python 
    * What's the difference between python and perl?
        old new
        system support
    * What's the difference between a python list and a tuple?
        list can be changed, while tuple can not
    * What's the difference between a python dictionary and a set?
        map and set
    * What is **kwargs and *args?
        kwargs has keyword
    * What is the issue with using **kwargs and *args?
    * What is a python generator?
        generator is static
    * How to create a python module?
    * How does garbage collection in python work?
        similar to smart ptr
6) c++ code
    * Virtual inheritable, multiple inheritance, diamond pattern
    * Upcast, class hire key – how does the compiler deal with this?.
        - solution is to store pointers rather data from the class.
    * Asked some basics – what OO tools does C++ give you (polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation)
    * How would you write the game ‘battleships’?
    * 4x4 square, traversing outward spiral – looking for a recursive pattern.

    * Compute max product of 3 integers from an array. Start to finish. As efficient as possible.
    * Multithreaded development experience
7) Algo
    If you have 3 variables, X,Y & Z. And you know the correlation between X&Y and Y&Z – can you say anything about the correlation between X&Z?
        a)       Yes, correlation matrix between all 3. You can derive upper and lower bounds.
                    Pearson formula.
    If you have a large data set (1 billion time series data points) how would you
        a)       Compute the mean of the last 1 million data points
        b)       Compute the median of the last 1 million data points
